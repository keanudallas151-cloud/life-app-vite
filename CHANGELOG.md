# Changelog

## v0.6.8 — Security, config, and core Supabase hardening
- Removed the tracked local `.env` file from git and expanded ignore rules for local AI/editor noise.
- Standardized the app on canonical `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL` and `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_PUBLISHABLE_KEY` env names.
- Removed stale Netlify deployment config and aligned deployment/docs around Vercel.
- Added a core Supabase migration for `user_data`, `quiz_stats`, `posts`, `comments`, and `post_votes` with indexes, defaults, triggers, and RLS.
- Hardened Post-It empty-feed loading and cloud-data migration detection without changing the guest/offline app flow.

## v0.6.7 — Navigation, avatars, settings, and Gemini guide
- Added profile picture upload to the account profile page — tap the avatar circle to choose a photo.
- Profile photo uploads to a dedicated Supabase storage bucket (profile-avatars), separate from Inventors & Investors media.
- Photo is persisted to Supabase auth user_metadata and updates live in app state without a page reload.
- PostIt / Reddit-style feed now shows the poster's real profile photo next to every post and comment. Falls back to initials if no photo is set.
- Added author_avatar_url column to posts and comments tables via migration.
- Reader parchment page now has genuine SVG feTurbulence paper grain texture layered over the existing gradients. Works in both light and dark reading mode. No external image request — baked as a data URI.
- Removed duplicate font-size 16px media query block from index.css (was covered by comprehensive block added in v0.6.6).
- Replaced the old direct Life shortcuts with a `Browse Life` hub that opens grouped navigation cards for onboarding, momentum, goals, and quiz flows.
- Reorganized `Settings` account actions into clearer Profile & Access, Privacy & Legal, and Progress & Reset groups, including surfaced account details and a direct account page jump.
- Added a practical `GEMINI.md` with architecture rules, safe-edit guidance, release context, ready-to-use prompts, and a bug-hunt map for the app.
- Aligned release metadata and planning docs with the current `v0.6.7` version.
